### De Morgan's laws

1. Original function and its variants using only NOR, NAND and NOT logic gates.

2. Functions from the picture above written in VHDL.

```vhdl
architecture dataflow of gates is
begin
    f_org_o  <= (not(b_i) and a_i) or (not(c_i) and not(b_i));
    f_nand_o <= (not(b_i) nand a_i) nand (not(c_i) nand not(b_i));
    f_nor_o  <= not((b_i nor not(a_i)) nor (c_i nor b_i));
end architecture dataflow;
```

3. Truth table of the above functions.

| **c** | **b** |**a** | **f(c,b,a)_ORG** | **f(c,b,a)_NAND** | **f(c,b,a)_NOR** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### Distributive laws

1. Screenshot with simulated time waveforms. Always display all inputs and outputs (display the inputs at the top of the image, the outputs below them) at the appropriate time scale!
